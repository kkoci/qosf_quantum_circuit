## QOSF Task

I've explained this on the slack channel, since I exchanged jobs just one day after my submission, I just started to work on this on last friday. 

So, this work is based on a previous study I did few months before with Quantum Gates, it is a simple QAOA algorithm implementation, there is the jupyter notebook, which can be tested on the IBM quantum experience. 

There is also a little experiment with Hadamard gates, the file is called qis.py. it can be run from python console.
